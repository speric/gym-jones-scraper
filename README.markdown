<p>I've been a fan of <a href="http://gymjones.com">Gym Jones</a> since 2006.  Their old website was simple and brilliant, with numerous photos accompanying each day's workout.  One thing that frustrated me about their old site though was that you had to click through to each day to see the photos; there was no way to simply browse all the photos on the site, like in a gallery.</p>
<p>Being lazy and not wanting to click unnecessarily, I wrote a script which scraped their entire site for those workout photos, saved the information to a database, and eventually built a webapp that was simply a gallery of Gym Jones images.</p>
<p>A few months after making the site live, and sharing the links with some friends, I got the following email from Mark Twight, founder of Gym Jones:</p>

	Hello Eric,

	I hope all is well in the New Year.

	At some point during the last few weeks I stumbled across your script to search images in the GJ database. 
	It was such a cool idea that we decided to write our own to run within the site. We will turn it on later 
	today, and at that point we might turn off the hot-linking option on the site, which my webmaster tells me 
	will prevent your script from working. I haven't made the final decision on it yet but it may happen so I 
	wanted to let you know.

	And to say thank you for the time and attention put into writing that script in the first place.

	Take care,
	Mark

<p>The <a href="http://gymjones.com/gallery/">Gym Jones Gallery</a> is now, I think, one of the coolest features of the site.  Somehow, I lost the code that made up the gallery app, but I found the scraper I wrote.  It was simple, and it won't work now, but it was a fun hack that had an impact.</p>
